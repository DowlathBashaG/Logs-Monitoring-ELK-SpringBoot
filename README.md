## The Evolution of the Elastic Stack

The acronym ELK stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, three open-source projects that form a powerful 

stack for log ingestion and visualization, log search, event analysis, and helpful visual metrics for monitoring applications.

### E lasticsearch is the heart of the stack: a JSON-based search and analytics engine, distributed and scalable. 

   It was built on top of Apache Lucene and provides a JSON REST API, cluster management, high availability, and fault tolerance.

###  L ogstash is an ETL (extract, transform, load) tool to enrich documents, run data processing pipelines. 

These pipelines ingest data from multiple sources, transform and send it to Elasticsearch.

## K ibana provides the visualization front-end, a window into the Elastic Stack. With dashboards and visualization elements,

the data stored in Elasticsearch can be explored, aggregated and analyzed.
